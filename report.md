# Introduction/Bussiness Problem
A client wants to open a restaurant in Toronto. In which neighborhood should he go for?
On one hand, well established restaurants are in a good location because they get lots of clients. This might be
because of other nearby venues or workplaces. On the other hand, competition might be an issue and not enough people
will change restaurants. By utilizing geospatial data, we will try to find neighborhoods similar to restaurant packed ones.

# Data
We are using wikipedia for a list of Toronto neighborhoods that are spatially close (postal code). Some previous csv file 
from coursera class with latitude and longitude coordinates for neighborhoods. And FourSquare API to explore venues of 
the neighborhoods.
